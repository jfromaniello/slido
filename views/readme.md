This is my node.js pet project.

Introduction 
============

Slido lets you write your slide show presentation using the [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) in a simple web interface and generate an awesome HTML5 slide show like Google's [HTML5Rocks presentation](http://slides.html5rocks.com/).


Inspired in
===========

This project is heavily inspired in the ruby [Slide Show (S9)](http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/) project.</p>
The main difference is that you can use this from the browser, while S9 is a command-line utiliy.


How to run it?
==============

Clone this in your local repository, run
	
	npm install

run

	node index.js

You should have mongodb installed in your machine to run it.


I don't want to run it locally!
===============================

I have deployed Slido to heroku. You can use it [here](http://slido.herokuapp.com).

If you want to prevent other people editing your slide, log-in with the facebook button and then save it.
